7-games-in-7-days
===================

I made 7 games in 7 days with Unity (https://unity3d.com/) to learn Unity, to prepare for Ludum Dare 29 and to be able to use it to take on larger projects using it.

The initial goal I set myself was to make a single game in Unity (https://unity3d.com/) a day for entire week (starting on 2014-04-18) in order for me to prepare for Ludum Dare 29 and to learn it enough such that afterwards I could use it to take on larger projects in the future.

## Games
Day 1: Box Box Fling
Fling as many squares and circles into the interdimensional portal to save the universe!

Day 2: Generic Shmup
Destroy the enemy ships to save the world in this intergalactic space shmup!

Day 3: Swipe Mastery
Prove your mastery of swiping by swiping over the numbers in order!

Day 4: Pickup and Throw
Pickup and throw the red aliens to prevent them from invading your home planet!

Day 5: Signal Interceptor
Intercept scrambled transmissions to satisfy your evil mega-corporation employers!

Day 6: Hyper Bumper Cars
Experience the most realistic bumper car simulator you will ever play!

Day 7: Infinite Faller
Can you fall forever without getting smashed to pieces by other things that are also falling forever?

## Post Mortem
Thoughts
I accomplished my initial goal, I'm looking forward to my first Ludum Dare and I had such fun during the week that I've decided that I will develop, polish and release a single larger game using Unity per month over the summer.

I'll be working full-time at an internship during the day and at night I'll be working on my game making skills as well as leaving some time for relaxing, reading and playing other people's games.

### The Good
Found Music Tracker for Making Chiptune Music
For the past couple weeks before this week of games, I had been searching for a simple easy-to-use program for making chiptune music but everything I found was meant for experts and had ridiculous hardcore interfaces.

So I was very happy to find [Boscea Coeil][https://boscaceoil.net/] which was exactly what I was looking for. I used it to make the chiptune music for Signal Interceptor and Infinite Faller and I plan on using it in the future because it's an amazing tool.

Improvement over time
During the course of the seven days, there was a noticeable improvement in the quality of the games that I was able to make as well as a significant decrease in the amount of time it took me to make each of them going from around 9h for my first game Box Box Fling to around 3h for my last game Infinite Faller.

Learned Unity
I learned Unity and gained experience with it enough that I can say that's it's been one of the best game frameworks that I've used due to the ease with which I was able to go from an idea to a game and as such in the future I will be favoring Unity over other frameworks when making prototypes and participating in game jams. I'll need to wait and see if Unity is as good with larger projects as it is for smaller ones but I have high hopes for it.

Set Goals for Myself
I set a specific goal at the start (to make a game a day for an entire week) and I was able to accomplish that specific. Compared to all my previous game development, where the work was more touch and go without any specific goals, I was much more focused on accomplishing the task that I had set out for myself rather than just working willy-nilly on anything and everything without any true focus.

### The Bad
Controls/Usability
Suggesting to players to use the right click for removing cars in Hyper Bumper Cars was a bad idea when deploying to web because it brings up the unity web player menu.

Using movement controls relative to the player's rotation can sometimes be confusing initially for the player (favor absolute controls in the future).

Also, in my first two games I don't display the controls anywhere which is quite bad especially for my first game Box Box Fling because of its non-standard control scheme (using the mouse to click on objects, move the mouse then release to "fling").
