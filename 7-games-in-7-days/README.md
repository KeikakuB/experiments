7-games-in-7-days
===================

I made 7 games in 7 days with Unity (https://unity3d.com/) to learn Unity, to prepare for Ludum Dare 29 and to be able to use it to take on larger projects using it.

Check out post-mortem as well as playable from the browser versions of the games by following the link: http://billtowin.github.io/7-games-in-7-days/
