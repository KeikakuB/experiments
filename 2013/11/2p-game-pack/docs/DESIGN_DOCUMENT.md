============

Collection of many small 2D games meant for 2 players to compete with each other.

**Game**s:
- are short in duration, around 30s to 1min
- end in a win for one player and a loss for the other or a tie

The number of wins, losses and ties for each player, in other words each player's **Stats**, should be remembered and displayed after each game.

**Player**s play Games in **Round**s. 

Before starting play, Players will customize a Round to their liking (or use the defaults):
- Which games they'd like to play by choosing manually, selecting all of them or selecting by one or many characteristics (**Speed**, **ReactionTime**, **Strategy**, ...) tied to each game.
- Specify how long they want to play based on different factors (**Time-Based**: time to play, **Wins-Based**: number of wins/losses to reach, **Games-Based** number of Games to play).
